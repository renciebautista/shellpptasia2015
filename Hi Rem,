Hi Rem,

My comments:

1. When the attendee click the link from our email invitation, they should be directed first to the log-in page where they'll be prompted to enter their username (email)  and password (PPTAsia2015). After the successful login, they will be then directed to the homepage. 

2. Where is the Event Registration page?

3. HOMEPAGE: 
3.a The links were not included at the bottom page:
§    Watch the Shell Powering Progress Together – Asia 2014 Lookback Film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKg_gh_fBs
§    Know more about Shell Powering Progress Together: http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/events/powering-progress-together/what-is-ppt.html
3.b. Highlight/Bold "Rappler" in 3rd paragraph 
Former Bloomberg and current Aljazeera broadcast journalist Maryam Nemazee and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa will moderate the forum.

4. HOTEL
4.a Use Hotel Information as page name, not Hotel only
4.b. Please revise the text in the Hotel page. Use this instead, with corrections:

During Powering Progress Together and Shell Eco Marathon, Manila will be visited by a lot of people. Therefore, it can be hard to get a hotel room. Since we are in contact with most of the hotels in Manila, we can help you book a hotel room. Please take note a hotel room is at your own expense.


5. CONFIRMATION EMAIL: Please find attached word file containing the text that will be emailed to attendees after they finished registering to the site.

Question: What email address will be used to send this confirmation email? Will it come from your system?


Please finish this after lunch so we can send to Claire for her comments to finalize.


ABBEY,

For your further comments and suggestions, please!


Thanks,

Zoe
