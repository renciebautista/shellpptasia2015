		<p>Building on last year’s themes – the energy-water-food stress nexus and the role resilience can play in addressing future resource stresses – this edition of <strong>Shell Powering Progress Together Asia</strong> will focus on <strong>Resilience in an Urbanising World</strong> and the key role cities will play to be liveable and sustainable.  This is a significant topic for Asia since it is the most populous continent, and home to over half of the world’s megacities.</p>
		<p>This one-day event will include four interactive sessions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Resilience: Current Thinking and Trends</strong> – creates a deeper understanding of resilience and urbanisation in the face of the stress nexus, with special focus on the challenges and opportunities for Asian cities;</li>
			<li><strong>Case Studies on Resilience for Cities</strong> – discusses how innovative and eco-conscious urban planning can transform cities into smart hubs for sustainable progress; </li>
			<li><strong>Implications on Resilience for Business</strong> - explores how resource scarcity is helping business and civil society work in collaboration to design strategies to be resilient; and</li>
			<li><strong>Inspiring Stories of Innovation and Resilience</strong> - shares stories of innovative disaster mitigation and management as well as rehabilitation in response to climate risks </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Former <strong>Bloomberg and current Aljazeera broadcast journalist Maryam Nemazee</strong> and <strong>Rappler CEO Maria Ressa</strong> will moderate the forum.</p>
		<p>The event once again gathers some 300 of thought leaders from business, government and civil society to engage in a dialogue, address resiliency through multi-sector collaboration, and explore on-the-ground actions.</p>
		<p><strong>Shell Powering Progress Together Asia 2015</strong> once more coincides with <strong>Shell Eco-marathon Asia</strong>, a unique event bringing together hundreds of student teams from countries across Asia and the Middle East to design, build, test and compete in self-built cars to travel a set distance on the least amount of fuel – in the process pushing the boundaries of fuel efficiency.  Delegates of Powering Progress Together Asia will have the opportunity to visit the Shell Eco-marathon Asia paddocks and Fan Zone area.</p>
